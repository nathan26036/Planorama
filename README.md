# Planorama

### Description
Planorama is an event planner you’ll need for your business, big or small.
Our passion lies in creating seamless, unforgettable experience for all employees.
From birthday parties to big corporate events to virtual meetings, any event, you’ll be able to share and create moments with those you work with.

With this Application you will be able to plan and create events for everyone to see and be able to check when the event is to see if it fite in their schedule.

### What We Did
* Developed a server that defines the model for users, events, and RSVP
* Created Resolvers and mutations for login, adding events, removing events, and rsvp
* Created a server auth that authenticates the user by verifying a token
* Created a client side auth that creates tokens on logging in and out
* Created different pages and components and pages that get put together in the app.jsx to make a full page
